# PNC
A PNC system written in PHP by me, don't be mean about my terrible code

# Config

Config file is quite self explanatory, a .SQL file is included. Please note there is **no** login system in place, this system is open and it is up to **you** to sort it out, I recommend https://github.com/panique/php-login-minimal for a basic login system, if you need a more extensive login and management system, contact me privately at james@radley.xyz.

# Backend
To access the backend just add ?task=civ&supersecret=letmein# to the end of your URL.

# YOU MUST USE PHP 5, 7 isn't supported
If you would like to upgrade it to MYSQLI for me it would be most appreciated, just message me and I'll add you as a contributor.
